Space Invaders Game (1st Year College)

# Abstract
"CaloiorsDeElite" is a game, inspirated by the classic "Space Invaders" and "Universidade do Minho" pop-culture. Between easter eggs and inside jokes,
we made something funny and enjoyable which keeps the feeling of an electronics student here in UMinho.
